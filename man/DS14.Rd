\details{
The DS14 (Denollet, 2005) is the most accepted and widely used diagnostic instrument for the assessment of the type-D pattern.
Type D (distressed) is defined as the joint tendency towards negative affectivity (e.g., worry, irritability, gloom) and 
social inhibition (e.g., reticence and a lack of self-assurance).
DS14 contains 14 items, each having five ordered response categories 
(0 = completely disagree, 1 = disagree, 2 = agree nor disagree, 3 = agree, 4 = completely agree).
Items 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 13 measure negative affectivity.
Items 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 14 measure social inhibition. Items 1 and 3 are negatively worded (indicated by an asterisk in the \code{dimnames}).

The data contain the gender (\code{Male}) of the patients (1 = male, 0 =  female), the age (\code{Age}) of the patients in years,
and the scores to DS14. Ten item scores are missing. Items 1 and 3 must be recoded before the data can beused meaningfully.
The data have been used to investigate predictive value of social inhibition and negative affectivity for 
cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (Denollet et al., 2013),
to investigate the relation between Type D and inflammation and endothelial dysfunction' (van Dooren et al., 2016),
and to investigate the relation between Type D and increased macrophage activity (Zuccarella-Hackl et al., 2016)
These data have also been analyzed in papers on Mokken scale analysis (Sijtsma and Van der Ark, 2016; Straat et al., 2016).
